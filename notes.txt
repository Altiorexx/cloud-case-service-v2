    rust might be a solution for developing a more reliable and robust collaboration service, 
    as the 'case service' should maybe not exist, as it has been discussed to split each solution
    into their own service, rather than have a unified service for all solutions.

    Here Rust + Rocket can be the tool of choice when building the realtime collaboration service, 
    which should be reusable for all future products. (glhf lol?)

    Rust seems to be awfully helpful when developing less runtime error prone services, which is 
    nice. Also lower memory footprint.
    The developer experience beats go abit is to be believed.


    ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, leave rust for now and stick to using known tools (Go) to finish up the
    Altiore Portal.
    
    --> When the CIS18 requirement specification is outlined, Rust may be a new tool to introduce.
